			<p>I am a visual designer, originally from the United Kingdom but now living in Atlanta and currently woking for Georgia Tech. I studied Graphic Design at Batley School of Art before attending De Montfort University in Leicester, England and graduating in the summer of 2004 with a BA in Multimedia Design.</p>
			<p>Since then I have worked across digital and traditional media; building and crafting my skills in digital, interaction, interface, experience, brand, and print design disciplines.</p>		
			<p>Some of the amazing agencies that I have worked for on either a contract or full-time basis have included Big Motive in Belfast, Supervox in Minneapolis, Think Company in Philadelphia, Maskar in Philadelphia and Ph.D Design in Santa Monica.</p>
			<p>I love to craft usable, simple, and creative solutions for complicated problems. I have worked on client accounts large and small, across most sectors. Some of the more well known clients include:</p>
		

			<ul>
				<li>BBC</li>
				<li>BP</li>
				<li>Georgia Tech</li>
				<li>Sony</li>
				<li>Synchrony Financial (formerly GE Capital</li>
				<li>TDK</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I've had the pleasure of working with top design studios and marketing agencies on both sides of the Atlantic. This has given me an extensive and diverse skill set across digital, brand, and print design. I believe that I am a well-rounded designer and natural problem solver. 

			I work well under pressure, with the ability to change gears and switch rapidly between different projects. My varied background and experiences have given me a responsive, nimble, and can do attitude.</p>
